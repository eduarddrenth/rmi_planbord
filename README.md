# rmi_planbord

This planning board started off as a digital replacement for a simple but effective board used in printing industry. It evolved into a distributed board with a centralized table model and remote client GUI's.
Later on I changed this project into a workshop rmi (see .odp in the project). Several themes such serialization, swing table with custom objects, editing custom objects in place in a cell, drag and drop using transferables, are addressed in this project.
